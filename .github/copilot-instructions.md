# Instructions for Copilot

Important: remember to add unit tests for any new functionality you add.
This is mission critical code, so we need to ensure that it works as expected and doesn't break anything.

You can find the tests in the `tests` directory and be compatible with pytest.
You can run the tests with `pytest` and check the coverage with `pytest --cov`.

We need a high level of test coverage, so please make sure to add tests for any new functionality you add.
