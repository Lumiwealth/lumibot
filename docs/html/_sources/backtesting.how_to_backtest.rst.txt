How To Backtest
===================================

Backtesting is a vital step in validating your trading strategies using historical data. With LumiBot, you can backtest strategies across various data sources such as **Yahoo Finance**, **Polygon.io**, **ThetaData**, or even your own custom **CSV** files. This guide will walk you through each step of backtesting, explain the data sources, and introduce the files that LumiBot generates during backtesting.

.. note::

   **Why Backtest?**
   
   Backtesting allows you to see how your strategies would have performed in the past, helping you identify weaknesses or strengths before deploying them in live markets.

Installing LumiBot
-----------------------------------

Before you begin, make sure LumiBot is installed on your machine. You can install LumiBot using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install lumibot

**4. Pandas (CSV or Other Custom Data)**

- Allows for full flexibility by using your own custom datasets (e.g., CSV, database exports).
- Ideal for advanced users but requires more manual configuration.

For more details, see the :ref:`Pandas Backtesting <backtesting.pandas>` section.

Running a Backtest with Polygon.io
-----------------------------------

Once you've selected your data source and built your strategy, you can run your backtest using the `run_backtest` function. This function requires:

- **Data source**: (e.g., Yahoo, Polygon.io, ThetaData, or Pandas)
- **Start and end dates**: The period you want to test.
- **Additional parameters**: Strategy-specific parameters.

Here's an example of a backtest using **Polygon.io**:

.. important::

   **You Must Use Your Polygon.io API Key**

   Make sure to replace `"YOUR_POLYGON_API_KEY"` with your actual API key from Polygon.io for the backtest to work.

.. code-block:: python

    from datetime import datetime
    from lumibot.backtesting import PolygonDataBacktesting
    from lumibot.strategies import Strategy

    class MyStrategy(Strategy):
        parameters = {
            "symbol": "AAPL",
        }

        def initialize(self):
            self.sleeptime = "1D"  # Sleep for 1 day between iterations

        def on_trading_iteration(self):
            if self.first_iteration:
                symbol = self.parameters["symbol"]
                price = self.get_last_price(symbol)
                qty = self.portfolio_value / price
                order = self.create_order(symbol, quantity=qty, side="buy")
                self.submit_order(order)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        polygon_api_key = "YOUR_POLYGON_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual Polygon.io API key
        backtesting_start = datetime(2025, 1, 1)
        backtesting_end = datetime(2025, 5, 1)
        result = MyStrategy.run_backtest(
            PolygonDataBacktesting,
            backtesting_start,
            backtesting_end,
            benchmark_asset="SPY",
            polygon_api_key=polygon_api_key  # Pass the Polygon.io API key here
        )

Optional: Using Environment Variables for Backtest Dates
-----------------------------------

Instead of specifying `backtesting_start` and `backtesting_end` in your code, you can set these environment variables:

- ``IS_BACKTESTING``
- ``BACKTESTING_START``
- ``BACKTESTING_END``

If they are set, LumiBot will automatically pick them up. For example:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 20 60 20

   * - **Variable**
     - **Description**
     - **Example**
   * - IS_BACKTESTING
     - Set to **"True"** to run in backtesting mode, or **"False"** for live (defaults to False).
     - False
   * - BACKTESTING_START
     - Start date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
     - 2025-01-01
   * - BACKTESTING_END
     - End date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
     - 2025-05-01

Below is a short example showing how you might rely *entirely* on environment variables and **omit** any explicit date definitions in code. The same `polygon_api_key` parameter is still required if you are using Polygon.io:

.. code-block:: python

    from lumibot.backtesting import PolygonDataBacktesting
    from lumibot.strategies import Strategy

    class MyStrategy(Strategy):
        parameters = {
            "symbol": "AAPL",
        }

        def initialize(self):
            self.sleeptime = "1D"

        def on_trading_iteration(self):
            if self.first_iteration:
                symbol = self.parameters["symbol"]
                price = self.get_last_price(symbol)
                qty = self.portfolio_value / price
                order = self.create_order(symbol, quantity=qty, side="buy")
                self.submit_order(order)

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # If BACKTESTING_START/BACKTESTING_END are set in the environment,
        # LumiBot will pick them up automatically.
        polygon_api_key = "YOUR_POLYGON_API_KEY"
        result = MyStrategy.run_backtest(
            PolygonDataBacktesting,
            polygon_api_key=polygon_api_key
        )

Files Generated from Backtesting
===================================

When you run a backtest in LumiBot, several important files are generated. These files provide detailed insights into the performance and behavior of the strategy. Each file is crucial for understanding different aspects of your strategy's execution.

Tearsheet HTML
-----------------------------------

LumiBot generates a detailed **Tearsheet HTML** file that provides visual and statistical analysis of your strategy’s performance. The tear sheet includes:

- Equity curve
- Performance metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio, drawdown)
- Benchmark comparisons

For more information, see the :ref:`Tearsheet HTML <backtesting.tearsheet_html>` section.

Trades Files
-----------------------------------

The **Trades File** logs every trade executed during the backtest, including:

- The asset traded
- The quantity of the trade
- The price at which the trade was executed
- The timestamp of the trade

This file is essential for reviewing your strategy's trading behavior and identifying any potential issues or optimizations.

For more information on how to interpret the **Trades Files**, see the :ref:`Trades Files <backtesting.trades_files>` section.

Indicators Files
-----------------------------------

The **Indicators File** logs any technical indicators used in your strategy, such as moving averages, RSI, or custom indicators. This file helps you understand how your strategy responded to market conditions based on specific indicators.

For more information, see the :ref:`Indicators Files <backtesting.indicators_files>` section.

Conclusion
-----------------------------------

LumiBot’s backtesting feature provides a powerful framework for validating your strategies across multiple data sources. By following this guide, you can quickly set up your environment, choose a data source, and begin backtesting with confidence.
