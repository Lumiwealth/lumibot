## Key Findings

### 1. Cash Tracking is Perfect

The most critical validation: cash tracking across 863 real trades with complex strategy logic.

**MES Momentum EMA Strategy:**
```
Starting Cash:        $100,000.00
Total Gross P&L:      $6,525.00
Total Fees:           -$863.00
Expected Final Cash:  $105,662.00
Actual Final Cash:    $105,662.00
Difference:           $0.00 ✅
```

### 2. All Contract Multipliers Verified

| Symbol | Multiplier | Margin | Trades Verified |
|--------|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| MES | 5 | $1,300 | 866 |
| ES | 50 | $13,000 | 6 |
| MNQ | 2 | $1,700 | 6 |
| NQ | 20 | $17,000 | 4 |
| GC | 100 | $10,000 | 2 |

### 3. Mark-to-Market Accounting Works

**Portfolio Value Behavior:**
- Portfolio value correctly equals cash when no position held ✅
- Portfolio value tracks cash + unrealized P&L during hold ✅
- No notional value inflation (portfolio doesn't jump to cash + $23k for MES) ✅

**Evidence from MES EMA Strategy:**
- Max portfolio: $105,663 (reasonable)
- Min portfolio: $70,541 (within expected drawdown)
- No unrealistic spikes or crashes

### 4. Multiple Simultaneous Positions Supported

Test verified independent tracking of MES and ES positions held at the same time:
- Each instrument maintains separate entry price ✅
- Margin deducted for each position ✅
- P&L calculated independently ✅
- Final cash within $2 of expected ✅

### 5. Entry Price Lookup Works Perfectly

The critical bug concern from earlier testing was resolved. Entry price lookup works correctly for:
- Sequential trades (863 verified) ✅
- Multiple instruments (verified) ✅
- Simultaneous positions (verified) ✅

### 6. Short Selling Fully Implemented ✅ (Oct 1, 2025)

Short selling is now fully supported and tested:
- ✅ SELL to open short position
- ✅ BUY to cover short position
- ✅ Inverted P&L calculation: profit = (entry - exit) × multiplier
- ✅ Margin handling for short positions
- ✅ Entry price lookup for both long and short positions
- ✅ Test verification: $0.00 cash difference

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Core Accounting Logic

**Entry Trade (BUY):**
```python
margin_required = get_futures_margin_requirement(asset)
new_cash = current_cash - margin_required - fee
portfolio_value = cash  # Not cash + notional!
```

**Exit Trade (SELL):**
```python
# 1. Look up entry price from filled_orders
entry_price = find_most_recent_entry_price(asset)

# 2. Calculate realized P&L
realized_pnl = (exit_price - entry_price) * quantity * multiplier

# 3. Release margin and apply P&L
new_cash = current_cash + margin_required + realized_pnl - fee
```

**Mark-to-Market (During Hold):**
```python
unrealized_pnl = (current_price - entry_price) * quantity * multiplier
portfolio_value = cash + unrealized_pnl
```

### Key Files Modified
- `lumibot/strategies/strategy_executor.py` (lines 540-590)
  - Entry price lookup logic
  - Margin deduction on entry
  - Margin release and P&L on exit
