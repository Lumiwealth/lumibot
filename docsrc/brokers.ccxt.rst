Crypto Brokers (Using CCXT)
===========================

This is the guide for connecting to any cryptocurrency broker through Lumibot. For this, we use the CCXT library, which is a popular library for cryptocurrency trading. If you are interested (but not required!), you can find the documentation for CCXT here: https://ccxt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

CCXT is a versatile library for cryptocurrency trading, which enables Lumibot to interact with a wide range of cryptocurrency brokers including Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Kucoin, and many more. We are constantly adding support for more brokers, so if you don't see your broker listed here, please let us know and we'll add it!

LumiBot supports trading cryptocurrencies through CCXT, which provides access to many popular cryptocurrency exchanges. Each broker requires its own specific environment variables.

Features
--------

* **Cryptocurrency Trading**: Spot and margin trading
* **Multiple Exchanges**: Supports 7+ different cryptocurrency exchanges
* **Real-time Data**: Live order and position updates
* **Order Types**: Market, limit, stop orders
* **Auto-Detection**: Automatically connects when environment variables are set

Prerequisites
-------------

1. **Account**: Create an account with a supported cryptocurrency exchange
2. **API Credentials**: Generate API credentials from your exchange's website
3. **Environment Variables**: Set your broker's API credentials

.. note::
   **Easy Setup with .env File**
   
   LumiBot automatically loads your API credentials from a `.env` file! Simply create a `.env` file in the same folder as your trading strategy and add your broker's environment variables. LumiBot will automatically detect and use these credentials - no additional configuration required.
   
   **Example .env file:**
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      # For Kraken
      KRAKEN_API_KEY=your_kraken_api_key_here
      KRAKEN_API_SECRET=your_kraken_secret_here
      
      # For Binance  
      BINANCE_API_KEY=your_binance_api_key_here
      BINANCE_SECRET=your_binance_secret_here
   
   That's it! LumiBot handles the rest automatically.

Important note: If you want to use CCXT for backtesting, you should use `CcxtBacktesting` as shown here instead: :ref:`CCXT Backtesting<CCXT Backtesting>`.

Before running any strategy, you first need to create an account on your desired broker and then obtain API credentials from the broker's website. Remember, each broker's website may be different, but you can generally find the API settings under account settings or something similar. Please see the documentation for your broker for more information on getting API credentials.

For trading with cryptocurrencies, always remember to set your market to 24/7 in the ``initialize`` function:

.. code-block:: python

    self.set_market("24/7")

   class MyStrategy(Strategy):
       def initialize(self):
           self.sleeptime = "1D"
           # Set the market to 24/7 since crypto markets are always open
           self.set_market("24/7")

       def on_trading_iteration(self):
           # Trade Bitcoin

           # Place a limit order
           if last_price:
               order = self.create_order(

In this example, we've demonstrated the following:

- How to place a market order and a limit order
- How to get historical data
- How to use technical analysis indicators
- How to get positions and orders
- How to get the current price
- How to get the current datetime
- How to get the value of the portfolio and the amount of cash in the account
