Deployment Guide
================

This guide will walk you through the deployment process for your trading strategy. We will cover the following topics:

- **Choosing Your Deployment Platform:** Decide whether to deploy on **Render** or **Replit**.
- **Deploying to Render:** Step-by-step instructions for deploying on Render.
- **Deploying to Replit:** Step-by-step instructions for deploying on Replit.
- **Secrets Configuration:** Detailed information on setting up your environment variables.
- **Broker Configuration:** Required secrets for different brokers.
- **General Environment Variables:** Additional environment variables required for the strategy to function correctly.

Before deploying your application, ensure that you have the necessary environment variables configured. The environment variables are crucial for the successful deployment of your application. We will cover the required environment variables for different brokers and general environment variables that are essential for the strategy to function correctly.

Example Strategy for Deployment
-------------------------------

.. important::

   **Important:** This example strategy is for those without a strategy ready to deploy. If you have your own strategy, skip to `Choosing Your Deployment Platform <#id1>`_.

Use this example to see the deployment process in action. Itâ€™s not intended for real-money use. More details are available in the GitHub repository: `Example Algorithm GitHub <https://github.com/Lumiwealth-Strategies/stock_example_algo>`_

To run the example strategy, click the Deploy to Render button or the Run on Repl.it button. See `Deploying to Render <#id2>`_ and `Deploying to Replit <#id3>`_ for more details.

Render is recommended for ease of use and affordability. Replit is more expensive but great for in-browser code editing, if you want to see/edit the code directly in your browser.

.. tip::

   **Tip:** Scroll down to the :ref:`Secrets Configuration <secrets-configuration>` section for detailed information on setting up your environment variables.

Choosing Your Deployment Platform
---------------------------------

We recommend using **Render** for deployment because it is easier to use and more affordable compared to Replit. However, **Replit** is an excellent choice for developers who want to edit code directly in the browser.

.. note::

   **Render** costs **$7/month**, while **Replit** is priced at **$25/month**. Choose the platform that best fits your needs and budget.

Deploying to Render
-------------------

Render offers powerful deployment options with easy scalability. Follow these steps to deploy your application on Render:

1. **Click the "Deploy to Render" Button**

   Start by clicking the **"Deploy to Render"** button on the GitHub repository.

   .. figure:: _static/images/render_deploy_button.png

3. **Navigate to the Worker**

   - **Navigate to the Background Worker:** Click on the name of the background worker, e.g., **options-butterfly-condor-worker-afas (Starter)** so you can configure this specific bot worker (we are currently in the blueprint configuration, not the bot itself).

   .. figure:: _static/images/render_worker.png
      :alt: Worker on Render
      :align: center

      **Figure 3:** Worker on Render.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   - **Select Environment:** On the worker's page, select **Environment** from the left sidebar.
   - **Edit Environment Variables:** Click **Edit** and fill in the required keys as detailed in the :ref:`Secrets Configuration <secrets-configuration>` section. Once you have added your values for the environment variables, click **Save**.
   - **Delete Unnecessary Variables:** If you have any unnecessary environment variables, you can delete them by clicking the **Delete (trashcan)** button next to the variable. One example of an unnecessary variable is `POLYGON_API_KEY` which is only used if you are backtesting.

   .. figure:: _static/images/render_worker_environment.png

      :align: center

      **Figure 4:** Editing Environment Variables on Render.

   .. note::

      **Note:** Only the environment variables required for your chosen broker are mandatory. Refer to the :ref:`Secrets Configuration <secrets-configuration>` section to see which ones are mandatory and which are optional. If an optional environment variable is not needed, **you can delete it.**

5. **Restart the Service**

   After configuring the environment variables, navigate to the top right corner and click **"Manual Deploy"**, then **"Deploy latest commit"** to apply the changes.

      **Figure 13:** Selecting Reserved VM and Background Worker on Replit.

   .. note::

      **Note:** Ensure that you have downgraded the vCPU before selecting the Background Worker to optimize costs effectively.

6. **Deployment Part 2**

   - **Downgrade vCPU:** We recommend downgrading to **0.25 vCPU** to reduce costs. As of today, it costs **$6/month** compared to the default **$12/month** for **0.5 vCPU**.
   - **Select Background Worker:** Choose **"Background Worker"**.
   - **Click Deploy:** Click **"Deploy"** to deploy your application.
   - **Wait for Deployment:** The deployment process may take a few minutes. Once completed, you will see a success message.

Secrets Configuration
=====================

Proper configuration of environment variables is crucial for the successful deployment of your application. The most important secrets are those related to your chosen broker. First, set up the secrets for your broker, then add any additional general secrets if needed.

.. tip::

   **Tip:** First, add the secrets for the broker you are using. After configuring the broker-specific secrets, you can add general secrets such as Discord webhook URLs or database connection strings.

.. important::

   **The secrets required for your chosen broker are mandatory, you only need to pick one. Also, depending on the strategy you are running, you might also need to set the `LIVE_CONFIG` environment variable.**

Final Steps
-----------

After configuring all the necessary environment variables and deploying your application on your chosen platform, ensure that everything is running smoothly:

- **Verify Deployment:** Check the deployment logs to ensure there are no errors.
- **Test Functionality:** Perform a few tests to confirm that the application behaves as expected.
- **Monitor Performance:** Use the monitoring tools provided by Render or Replit to keep an eye on your application's performance.

Conclusion
----------

Deploying your application is straightforward with our GitHub deployment buttons for **Render** and **Replit**. By following this guide, you can quickly set up your environment variables and get your application live. Happy deploying! ðŸŽ‰
