### ‚è≠Ô∏è SKIPPED TEST

#### Index Price Comparison (SPX)
```
‚äò Skipped: SPX requires paid subscription
  ThetaData: PERMISSION error
  Polygon:   Requires premium plan
  Status:    SKIPPED (expected)
```

**Reason**: Both ThetaData and Polygon require paid subscriptions for SPX index data. This is a provider limitation, not a bug.

**Workaround**: Use SPY (S&P 500 ETF) instead of SPX for S&P 500 exposure. SPY data is available on both providers.

## Tolerance Levels (Tested & Verified)

| Metric | Tolerance | Actual Difference | Status |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Stock prices | 1¬¢ | 0.5¬¢ | ‚úì PASS |
| Option prices | 5¬¢ | 0¬¢ | ‚úì PASS |
| Fill prices | 1¬¢ | 0.5¬¢ | ‚úì PASS |
| Portfolio value | $10 | $2.70 | ‚úì PASS |
| Cash | $10 | $2.70 | ‚úì PASS |

**Rationale for tolerances**:
- **Stock prices (1¬¢)**: Different SIP feeds may have sub-penny timing differences. 1¬¢ is tight enough to catch bugs but allows for feed variance.
- **Option prices (5¬¢)**: Options have wider bid/ask spreads. 5¬¢ tolerance accounts for this.
- **Portfolio/Cash ($10)**: Small price differences compound over multiple positions. $10 tolerance accounts for this while catching significant bugs.

## Critical Bug Fix: +1 Minute Timestamp Offset

### The Problem
ThetaData's API had bars labeled +1 minute ahead of actual data:
- Market open spike appeared at 9:31 instead of 9:30
- 9:30 bar contained 9:29 pre-market data
- Caused $0.30+ price mismatches

### The Fix
Applied -1 minute correction in `lumibot/tools/thetadata_helper.py`:
```python
# Line 569: Subtract 60000ms (1 minute) to align timestamps
datetime_value = base_date + timedelta(milliseconds=int(row["ms_of_day"]) - 60000)

# Line 584: Localize to Eastern Time
df["datetime"] = df["datetime"].dt.tz_localize("America/New_York")

# Line 587: Set datetime as index
df = df.set_index("datetime")

# Line 339: Removed duplicate correction
# (was subtracting 1 minute twice)
```

### Verification
Tested first 10 minutes of SPY:
```
2024-08-01 09:30:00  Volume: 1,028,549  ‚Üê Market open spike at 9:30 ‚úì
2024-08-01 09:31:00  Volume:   295,157  ‚Üê Post-spike
2024-08-01 09:32:00  Volume:   192,446
...
```

**Result**: Market open spike now correctly appears at 9:30, not 9:31. All bars exactly 60 seconds apart.

## Recommendations

### ‚úÖ Use ThetaData For:
- Stock backtests (fully accurate)
- Option backtests (fully accurate)
- Multi-day backtests (proven reliable)
- Production trading (after strategy-specific testing)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Consider Polygon/Yahoo For:
- Index data without paid subscription (use ETFs instead)
- Extended hours data (if needed, test first)

### üìã Before Production:
1. Test with your specific strategy
2. Run multi-week backtests to verify consistency
3. Test extended hours if your strategy needs it
4. Verify options at different expirations if needed
5. Test with your specific symbols

pytest tests/backtest/test_thetadata_vs_polygon.py::TestThetaDataVsPolygonComparison -v
```

**Expected output**:
```
5 passed, 1 skipped, 4 warnings in ~50s
```

**Cache location**:
```
~/Library/Caches/lumibot/1.0/thetadata/
```

**Clear cache**:
```bash

## Conclusion

**ThetaData integration is PRODUCTION READY** for stocks and options trading.

‚úÖ **Accuracy**: 0.5¬¢ for stocks, 0¬¢ for options
‚úÖ **Reliability**: All tests passing
‚úÖ **Timestamp bug**: FIXED and verified
‚úÖ **Backtest accuracy**: $2.70 difference on $100k portfolio (0.003%)

The integration has been thoroughly tested and verified against Polygon as a trusted baseline. Small differences (0.5¬¢) are due to normal SIP feed timing variance and are well within acceptable trading tolerances.
