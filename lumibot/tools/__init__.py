# TODO: Using * is really bad and leads to random circular imports (especially in polygon_helper and indicators)
# TODO: When using *, you have to ensure that the underlying module does not import ANYTHING from the lumibot package
# TODO: This tools module is a bad place to auto import as a helper to the code because all of the modules and functions
# TODO: are not related to each other. It's just a collection of random functions and classes and it is unclear what
# TODO: is being loaded when simply trying to load anything from the tools module. It's better to import the specific
# TODO: functions and classes that you need from the tools module. This has made everything from black_scholes to
# TODO: yahoo_helper all interrelated and it's a mess.
